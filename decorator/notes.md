## Interface Segregation Principle


- The I in SOLID
- Clients should not depend on methods they dont use
- The bigger the interface the weaker the abstraction (Rob Pike)
- Keep it small and independently
- Design behaviour around your data
- If c++ and Java are about type hierarchies and the taxonomy of types, Go is about composition
- Interface segregation
- Single method interface
- Any types can have methods attach to it

## DECORATOR PATTERN 

- Wraps a logic with extra behaviour(extends)
- Help to perform single responsability and open/closed principles
- A clousure is a function with enviroment
